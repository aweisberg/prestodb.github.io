<p><em>RaptorX is an internal project name aiming to boost query latency significantly beyond what vanilla Presto is capable of. This blog post introduces the hierarchical cache work, which is the key building block for RaptorX. With the support of the cache, we are able to boost query performance by 10X. This new architecture can beat performance oriented connectors like Raptor with the added benefit of continuing to work with disaggregated storage.</em></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Tl;dr: 2020 was a huge year for the Presto community. We held our first major conference, PrestoCon, the biggest Presto event ever. We had a massive expansion of our meetup groups with more than 20 sessions held throughout the year, and significant innovations were contributed to Presto!</p>
<p>This year has certainly been unique, to say the least. As chairperson of the Presto Foundation Outreach Committee, the term “outreach” took on a whole new meaning this year. But through the challenges of 2020, we adopted new ways to connect. We continued to build and engage with the Presto community in a new “virtual” way, and I couldn’t be more proud of all we’ve accomplished as a community in 2020.</p>
<p>So what did the Presto Foundation do in 2020?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Function evaluation is a big part of projection CPU cost. Recently we optimized a set of functions that use <code>TypedSet</code>, e.g.  <code>map_concat</code>, <code>array_union</code>, <code>array_intersect</code>, and <code>array_except</code>. By introducing a new <code>OptimizedTypeSet</code>, the above functions saw improvements in several dimensions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to 80% reduction in wall time and CPU time in JMH benchmarks</li>
<li>Reserved memory reduced by 5%</li>
<li>Allocation rate reduced by 80%</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, OptimizedTypeSet resolves the long standing issue of throwing <code>EXCEEDED_FUNCTION_MEMORY_LIMIT</code> for large incoming blocks: &quot;The input to function_name is too large. More than 4MB of memory is needed to hold the intermediate hash set.”</p>
<p>The <code>OptimizedTypeSet</code> and improvements to the above mentioned functions are merged to master, and will be available from Presto 0.244.</p>

<p>Unnest is a common operation in Facebook’s daily Presto workload. It converts an <code>ARRAY</code>, <code>MAP</code>, or <code>ROW</code> into a flat relation. Its original implementation used deep copy all the time and was very inefficient. In <a href="https://prestosql.io/blog/2019/08/23/unnest-operator-performance-enhancements.html">Unnest Operator Performance Enhancement with Dictionary Blocks</a>, the author improved the Unnest operator by up to 10x in CPU and elapsed times by using <code>DictionaryBlock</code> when possible. We went one step further and improved it for another 5-10x.</p>

<p><a href="https://hudi.apache.org">Apache Hudi</a> is a fast growing data lake storage system that helps organizations build and manage petabyte-scale data lakes. Hudi brings stream style processing to batch-like big data by introducing primitives such as upserts, deletes and incremental queries. These features help surface faster, fresher data on a unified serving layer. Hudi tables can be stored on the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) or cloud stores and integrates well with popular query engines such as <a href="https://prestodb.io">Presto</a>, <a href="https://hive.apache.org">Apache Hive</a>, <a href="https://spark.apache.org">Apache Spark</a> and <a href="https://impala.apache.org">Apache Impala</a>. Given Hudi pioneered a new model that moved beyond just writing files to a more managed storage layer that interops with all major query engines, there were interesting learnings on how integration points evolved.</p>
<p>In this blog we are going to discuss how the Presto-Hudi integration has evolved over time and also discuss upcoming file listing and query planning improvements to Presto-Hudi queries.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Migrating SQL workloads from a fully on-premise environment to cloud infrastructure has numerous benefits, including alleviating resource contention and reducing costs by paying for computation resources on an on-demand basis. In the case of Presto running on data stored in HDFS, the separation of compute in the cloud and storage on-premises is apparent since Presto’s architecture enables the storage and compute components to operate independently. The critical issue in this hybrid environment of Presto in the cloud retrieving HDFS data from an on-premise environment is the network latency between the two clusters.</p>
<p>This crucial bottleneck severely limits performance of any workload since a significant portion of its time is spent transferring the requested data between networks that could be residing in geographically disparate locations. As a result, most companies copy their data into a cloud environment and maintain that duplicate data, also known as Lift and Shift. Companies with compliance and data sovereignty requirements may even prevent organizations from copying data into the cloud. This approach is not scalable and requires introducing a lot of manual effort to achieve reasonable results. This article introduces <a href="https://www.alluxio.io/">Alluxio</a> to serve as a <a href="https://www.alluxio.io/data-orchestration/">data orchestration</a> layer to help serve data to Presto efficiently, as opposed to either directly querying the distant HDFS cluster or manually providing a localized copy of the data to Presto in a cloud cluster.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>A common type of spatial query involves relating one table of geometric
objects (e.g., a table <code>population_centers</code> with columns
<code>population, latitude, longitude</code>) with another such table (e.g., a table
<code>counties</code> with columns <code>county_name, boundary_wkt</code>), such as calculating
for each county the population sum of all population centers contained
within it. These kinds of calculations are called <em>spatial joins</em>. While
doing it for a single row each from <code>population_centers</code> and <code>counties</code> is
manageable, doing it efficiently for two large tables is challenging. In this
post, we'll talk about the machinery that Presto has built to make these
queries blazingly fast.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The article,  <a href="https://eng.uber.com/engineering-sql-support-on-apache-pinot/">Engineering SQL Support on Apache Pinot at Uber</a>, was originally published by Uber on the Uber Engineering Blog on January 15, 2020. Check out <a href="https://eng.uber.com/">eng.uber.com</a> for more articles about Uber's engineering work and follow Uber Engineering at <a href="https://twitter.com/UberEng">@UberEng</a> and Uber Open Source at <a href="https://twitter.com/UberOpenSource">@UberOpenSouce</a> on Twitter for updates from our teams.</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/2020-03-18-uber-pinot/shiny-thing.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Uber leverages real-time analytics on aggregate data to improve the user experience across our products, from <a href="https://eng.uber.com/uber-eats-risk-team/">fighting fraudulent behavior</a> on Uber Eats to <a href="https://eng.uber.com/forecasting-introduction/">forecasting demand</a> on our platform.</p>
<p>As Uber’s operations became more complex and we offered additional features and services through our platform, we needed a way to generate more timely analytics on our aggregated marketplace data to better understand how our products were being used. Specifically, we needed our Big Data stack to support cross-table queries as well as nested queries, both requirements that would enable us to write more flexible ad hoc queries to keep up with the growth of our business.</p>
<p>To resolve these issues, we built a solution that linked <a href="http://prestodb.github.io/">Presto</a>, a query engine that supports full ANSI SQL, and <a href="https://pinot.apache.org/">Pinot</a>, a real-time OLAP (online analytical processing) datastore. This married solution allows users to write ad-hoc SQL queries, empowering teams to unlock significant analysis capabilities.</p>
<p>By engineering full SQL support on Apache Pinot, users of our Big Data stack can now write complex SQL queries as well as join different tables in Pinot with those in other datastores at Uber. This new solution enables operations teams with basic SQL knowledge to build dashboards for quick analysis and reporting on aggregated data without having to spend extra time working with engineers on data modelling or building data pipelines, leading to efficiency gains and resource savings across the company.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Denormalized data with nested values (e.g. array/map) have become omnipresent in this Big Data era, as a lot of data naturally conforms to a nested representation [1, 2]. As a result it is important to provide an efficient and convenient way to query nested data. SQL traditionally does not include support for this.</p>
<p>The pioneering work of Dremel proposed an extension to SQL based on recursive relational algebra to allow querying nested records [1], and is now available in BigQuery and the SQL:2016 standard. The following example shows how to transform array elements with this (adapted from <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/arrays#creating-arrays-from-subqueries">BigQuery Docs</a>):</p>
<pre><code class="hljs css language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> elements,

<span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> (
    <span class="hljs-keyword">VALUES</span>
        (<span class="hljs-built_in">ARRAY</span>[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>]),
        (<span class="hljs-built_in">ARRAY</span>[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>, <span class="hljs-number">9</span>]),
        (<span class="hljs-built_in">ARRAY</span>[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">4</span>, <span class="hljs-number">16</span>, <span class="hljs-number">64</span>])

(<span class="hljs-number">3</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">rows</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>While nested relational algebra provides an elegant and unified approach to query nested data, we found it could be challenging for users to track the “unnest stack” in mind when writing the query. In our experience, users are more comfortable to apply a given function (e.g lambda) to each element in the collection. This motivates us to introduce lambda expressions into Presto to help query nested data, as illustrated below:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs css language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> elements, 
transform(elements, v -&gt; v * <span class="hljs-number">2</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> multiplied_elements
<span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> (
    <span class="hljs-keyword">VALUES</span>
        (<span class="hljs-built_in">ARRAY</span>[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>]),
        (<span class="hljs-built_in">ARRAY</span>[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>, <span class="hljs-number">9</span>]),
        (<span class="hljs-built_in">ARRAY</span>[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">4</span>, <span class="hljs-number">16</span>, <span class="hljs-number">64</span>])
) <span class="hljs-keyword">AS</span> t(elements)
</code></pre>
<p>In Presto, a lambda expression consists of an argument list and lambda body, separated by <code>-&gt;</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs css language-sql">x -&gt; x + 1
(x, y) -&gt; x + y
x -&gt; regexp_like(x, 'a+')
x -&gt; x[1] / x[2]
x -&gt; IF(x &gt; 0, x, -x)
x -&gt; COALESCE(x, 0)
x -&gt; CAST(x AS JSON)

<p>Note there is no type annotation in a lambda expression. The type of a lambda expression (e.g. <code>function(integer, integer)</code>) thus has to be inferred from the context of function call. As a result, standalone lambda expressions are not allowed since their types cannot be determined.</p>

<p>Presto defines a connector API that allows Presto to query any data source that has a connector implementation. The existing connector API provides basic predicate pushdown functionality allowing connectors to perform filtering at the underlying data source.</p>
<p>However, there are certain limitations with the existing predicate pushdown functionality that limits what connectors can do. The expressiveness of what can be pushed down is limited and the connectors can't change the structure of the plan at all.</p>

<p>We like Presto. We like it a lot — so much we want to make it better in every way. Here's an example: we just optimized the PartitionedOutputOperator. It's now 2-3x more CPU efficient, which, when measured against Facebook's production workload, translates to 6% gains overall. That's huge.</p>
<p>The optimized repartitioning is in use on some production Presto clusters right now, and available for use as of release 0.229.</p>
<p>In this note, let's go over how we did it, what optimizations we unlocked specifically, and a case study of how we approached opportunity sizing whether this was worth doing at all.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>In a multi-tenant system like Presto careful memory management is required to keep the system stable and prevent individual queries from taking over all the resources. However, tracking the memory usage of data structures in an application (Presto) running on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) requires a significant amount of work. In addition, Presto is a distributed system, which makes the problem more complicated. This post provides an overview of how memory management works in Presto, and provides info about the various memory management related JMX counters/endpoints that can be used for monitoring production clusters.</p>

<p>Presto is an open source distributed SQL query engine for running analytic queries against data sources of all sizes ranging from gigabytes to petabytes.</p>
<p>Presto was originally designed for interactive use cases, however, after seeing the merit in having a single interface for both batch and interactive, it is now also used heavily for processing batch workloads [6]. As a concrete example, more than 80% of new warehouse batch workloads at Facebook are developed on Presto. Its flexible “connector” design makes it possible to run queries against heterogeneous data sources — such as joining together Hive and MySQL tables without preloading the data.</p>
<p>However, memory-intensive (many TBs) and long-running (multiple hours) queries have been major pain points for Presto users. It is difficult to reason how much memory queries will use and when it will hit memory limit, and failures in long-running queries cause retries which create landing time variance. To improve user experience and scale MPP Database to large ETL workloads, we started this Presto Unlimited project.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>In the previous article we looked at the abstract problem statement and possibilities inherent in scanning tables. In this piece we look at the quantitative upside with Presto. We look at a number of queries and explain the findings.</p>
<p>The initial impulse motivating this work is the observation that table scan is by far the #1 operator in Presto workloads I have seen. This is a little over half of all Presto CPU, with repartitioning a distant second, at around 1/10 of the total. The other half of the motivation is ready opportunity: Presto in its pre-Aria state does almost none of the things that are common in table scan.</p>

<p>Table scan, on the face of it, sounds trivial and boring. What’s there in just reading a long bunch of records from first to last? Aren’t indexing and other kinds of physical design more interesting?</p>
<p>As data has gotten bigger, the columnar table scan has only gotten more prominent. The columnar scan is a fairly safe baseline operation: The cost of writing data is low, the cost of reading it is predictable.</p>
<p>Another factor that makes the table scan the main operation is the omnipresent denormalization in data warehouse. This only goes further as a result of ubiquitous use of lists and maps and other non-first normal form data.</p>
<p>The aim of this series of articles is to lay out the full theory and practice of table scan with all angles covered. We will see that this is mostly a matter of common sense and systematic application of a few principles: Do not do extra work and do the work that you do always in bulk. Many systems like Google’s BigQuery do some subset of the optimizations outlined here. Doing all of these is however far from universal in the big data world, so there is a point in laying this all out and making a model implementation on top of Presto. We are here talking about the ORC format, but the same things apply equally to Parquet or JSON shredded into columns.</p>
